# OrphanPrincipalComponentAnalysis

Research project developed regarding the Machine Learning Algorithms and Applications course at TU Wien, under the supervision of Maximilian Thiessen.

The project is based on the work developed in the following papers:

- Dino Oglic, Daniel Paurat, and Thomas Gärtner. Interactive Knowledge-Based Kernel PCA. Proceedings of ECML PKDD, 2014.
- Sven Giesselbach, Katrin Ullrich, Michael Kamp, Daniel Paurat, and Thomas Gärtner. Corresponding Projections for Orphan Screening.

The main topic is Cross-target Learning in multiple biological targets. The problem is about many machine learning applications when one has to start making decisions without having access to labelled training data specific to the task at hand. One approach, in that case, is to transfer knowledge from similar tasks. In this project, we have explored approaches that incorporate tasks and hypotheses together in the same space to find a good initial hypothesis for a new ("orphan") task. The new part developed in this project is related to OPCA.
